# DTech - Home Automation Prototype
This repository breaks down a complete home automation project into three stages: Hardware, Microcontroller and App.

- [Hardware](https://github.com/Yonyar/DTech-HW/tree/main/Hardware): Steps to build a compact PCB designed for IoT / Home automation applications
- [ESP32](https://github.com/Yonyar/DTech-HW/tree/main/ESP32): ESP32 Microcontroller programing using MQTT protocol
- [App (PWA)](https://github.com/Yonyar/DTech-HW/tree/main/App): Progressive web applications to interacts with hardware side

## Scope
The sole objective of this serie is the satisfaction of transforming creative ideas into functional prototypes through problem-solving and self-learning.  

I'm not any expert to give you unquestionable advice, I can only share my experience along the way.  

âœ¨ If you are passionate about this idea like I am, feel free to use this project as a reference to improve it and carry out your own creations!

> Note: It's convenient to start with [ESP32]() in order to test our PCB with neccesary ~magic~ logic.  
ESP32 microcontroller allow control lights (RGB or not) connecting via MQTT service from app.
