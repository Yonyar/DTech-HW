# DTech - Home Automation Prototype
This repository breaks down a complete home automation project into four stages:

- [**Hardware**](https://github.com/Yonyar/DTech-HW/tree/main/Hardware): Steps to build a compact PCB designed for IoT / Home automation applications
- [**ESP32**](https://github.com/Yonyar/DTech-HW/tree/main/ESP32): ESP32 Microcontroller programing using MQTT protocol
- [**RaspberryPi**](): working as a Hub (MQTT Broker)
- [**App**](https://github.com/Yonyar/DTech-HW/tree/main/App): Progressive web applications to interacts with hardware side

## Scope
The main objective of this series is to enjoy the process of transforming creative ideas into functional prototypes through problem-solving and self-learning.  

I'm not an expert offering unquestionable advice — I’m simply sharing my experiences along the way. 

✨ If you're passionate about this idea as I am, feel free to use this project as a reference to improve upon and create your own designs!
